# Intro
This is a typical task for a coding challenge which I have done in the past. It's a frontend implementation of an app displaying, searching, adding, deleting 
and editing users. 

It's built with: 
- React / React Router
- Typescript
- Vite/Vitest
- Material UI
- React Testing Library
- State Management with React Context + useReducer

## How to run

- `yarn install`
- `yarn dev`
- `yarn test`
